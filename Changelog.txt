- Updated Database (Added OwnerName, OpeningTimes, ClosingTimes, CoverIMG, BannerIMG, Menu, Orders)
- Updated Restaurant class & Controller to accommodate new entries
- Updated Orders Controller (temporarily to use the Orders entry in the Restaurants table to prevent errors)
- Initialised a bunch of shit with empty string to prevent errors & default secret token (very secure will fix later)

- Changed Restaurant signup to 2 step process, uses the new fields on the first page, second page has image uploads and operating hours
- Changed navbar to show owner name
- Added Restaurant Profile which displays info and allows editing and saving


To Do
- Add back clock icon for picking hours on signup (idk what happened to it)
- Build Menu system
- Make restaurants show up on user side
- Make menu show when clicking on a restaurant
- Make order system (add items to basket, add details such as address etc, increment or remove items from basket, edit items maybe, place order)
- Add basket and money (credit) to user database (Â£100 default)
- Make placed orders appear on restaurant side and let them clear them

Basically done after that
