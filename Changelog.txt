commit #2
- Fixed localStorage not storing details

To Do

- Make Restaurants and their details show up on user side
- Make Menu show up when clicking on a restaurant
- Make order system (add items to basket, add details such as address etc, increment or remove items from basket, edit items maybe, place order)
- Add basket and money (credit) to user database (£100 default)
- Make placed orders appear on restaurant side and let them clear them

QOL but also ToDo
- Function that averages cost of each category, then the average of that and displays £, ££, or £££ based on a price limit on user side
- Time to Delivery using map API
- Admin Panel, Analytics etc

Cleanup
- Ensure that code is clean, optimised, modular and encapsulated. 

EG switchcase for profile in navigation.js should call the function elsewhere (templates.js)
Restaurant profile could have its own controller etc, just see what works best
